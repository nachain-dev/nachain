## Overview
NA Chain is the pioneer of heterogeneous composite chain model, which integrates PowF, DPoS and DAG hybrid algorithms to rapidly improve efficiency and achieve millions of TPS in a second. The native cross-chain function is one of its advantages, which can greatly meet the network requirements of Web3.0 transmission while maintaining low cost and handling fee. Original N++ programming language to understand a certain Web development experience programmers within 5 minutes to learn, learn their own interactive system development, with N++ and NVM virtual machine to communicate, and then execute the issuance of tokens, transfer, data bus, data access, micro services and other tasks. Launch PC and desktop wallet integrated applications, such as the NaStation desktop Wallet released by NA Chain earlier, integrating functions such as merge wallet, developer store, DApp Store, miner management, smart contract, decentralized server, and decentralized file management. Interact with other blockchains through cross-chain docking.
